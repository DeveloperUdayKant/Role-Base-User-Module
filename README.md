# Role Base User Module
# Role-Based User Module

## Overview
The Role-Based User Module is designed to manage user authentication and authorization based on predefined roles. This module enables secure access control by assigning specific permissions to different user roles.

## Features
- User authentication (login, logout, registration)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User role assignment
- Permission management
- Middleware for route protection
- Admin panel for user and role management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- PHP (if using Laravel)
- Node.js and npm (if using frontend frameworks)
- Composer (for dependency management)
- Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/role-based-user-module.git
   cd role-based-user-module
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the environment file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Configure database in `.env` file:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```
5. Run migrations and seed roles:
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
6. Generate the application key:
   ```sh
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
7. Start the application:
   ```sh
   php artisan serve
   ```

## Usage
### Assigning Roles to Users
After seeding, roles like `admin`, `editor`, and `user` will be available. You can assign a role to a user using:
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->assignRole('admin');
```

### Middleware Protection
Protect routes based on roles using middleware:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin-dashboard', 'AdminController@index');
});
```
